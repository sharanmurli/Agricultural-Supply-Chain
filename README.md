# Agricultural Supply System with Permissioned Networks through Hyperledger Framework
---

## Overview

This project aims to create a framework that provides high data security and a simplified ecosystem for quick information exchange through Hyperledger Blockchain transactions. The potential of this technology is harnessed to benefit farmers and consumers by establishing a trusted distribution network, thus bringing data transparency solutions to the supply chain.

## Problem Statement

The current agricultural supply chain is a centralized system with numerous issues related to integrity, tracking, and organizing transactions. There is a lack of trust and transparency, leading to irregularities in the implementation of schemes. Consumers doubt the quality of the food supplied, and farmers and wholesalers are affected by payment frauds by middlemen. This project aims to resolve these issues by using blockchain technology and the Hyperledger framework to create a secure supply chain. The framework ensures high data security and facilitates quick and secure information exchange through Hyperledger Blockchain transactions.
